    "introduction": "Iâ€™ve always been curious about how intelligence works â€” human or artificial. That curiosity pulled me into AI, where I now spend my time building and experimenting. When Iâ€™m not debugging code, Iâ€™m usually on a hiking trailâ€¦ or being bossed around by my cat, Nyra.",
    "experience": "I'm also passionate about system design and software development, constantly seeking to optimize performance and create efficient, scalable solutions. My skill set spans across a range of languages, including Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and C++, enabling me to approach challenges from diverse angles.",
    "entrepreneurship": "At Puzles, I am reimagining how search works with AI. While others are busy building cursors for X, I am building a Perplexity for people search â€” a smarter way to connect brands with the right influencers. Just share your requirements and goals, and we will match you with the best voices to amplify your marketing. "
